            Outcome-based education (OBE) and continuous quality improvement
            (CQI) are two of the most important concepts in education today. OBE
            is a student-centered approach that focuses on the development of
            specific skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are relevant to the
            needs of the society. (Akir et al., 2012) CQI, on the other hand, is
            a continuous process of reviewing, analyzing, and improving
            educational practices and policies to ensure that the highest
            quality of education is delivered. (Misran et al.,2011) In recent
            years, there has been a growing interest in the development and
            utilization of new educational technologies and resources for
            inclusive education (Smith, 2018). This is because these
            technologies have the potential to significantly improve the
            efficiency and effectiveness of OBE-CQI processes.The University of
            Nueva Caceres, like many other educational institutions, has faced
            various challenges in implementing OBE-CQI effectively. One of the
            main challenges is the manual entry of data, which can be
            time-consuming and prone to errors (Liu & Huang, 2019). To address
            this challenge, the researchers propose to develop an Information
            Management System (IMS) to automate the data entry process.The IMS
            is expected to improve the inclusiveness of OBE-CQI at the
            University of Nueva Caceres by making the process more efficient and
            effective. By streamlining the data entry process, the faculty will
            be able to focus more on the important tasks of teaching and
            learning. Additionally, the IMS will also help to reduce the errors
            and inconsistencies that can occur in manual data entry (Chen,
            2021).Therefore, the research aims to design, develop, and evaluate
            the IMS for OBE-CQI at the University of Nueva Caceres. The study
            will focus on the following areas: variables or parameters to be
            measured and evaluated or analyzed; treatments to be used and their
            layout; experimental procedures and design; statistical analysis;
            evaluation method and observations to be made; and strategies for
            implementation.
