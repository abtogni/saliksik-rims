      <p class="mb-2 line-clamp-4">Outcome-based education (OBE) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) are two of the most important concepts in education today. OBE is a student-centered approach that focuses on the development of specific skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are relevant to the needs of the society. (Akir et al., 2012) CQI, on the other hand, is a continuous process of reviewing, analyzing, and improving educational practices and policies to ensure that the highest quality of education is delivered. (Misran et al.,2011) In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development and utilization of new educational technologies and resources for inclusive education (Smith, 2018). This is because these technologies have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OBE-CQI processes.</p>
